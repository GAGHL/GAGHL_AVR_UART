# GAGHL_AVR_UART

**A lightweight and minimal UART driver for AVR microcontrollers**

GAGHL_AVR_UART is a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) driver written in C, designed for use with AVR-based systems. It supports basic UART operations including initialization, transmitting & receiving data, sending strings from RAM or program memory, and converting integers to ASCII formats (decimal & hex).



## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Baud rate selection for `F_CPU = 8MHz` or `16MHz`
- ‚úÖ Send:
  - Single characters
  - Null-terminated strings from RAM
  - Strings from program memory (PROGMEM)
  - 32-bit unsigned integers as decimal or hex
- ‚úÖ Receive characters or strings with CR/LF detection


## üìö API Overview

| Function             | Parameters                     | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uart_init()`        | `uart_baud_t baud`             | Initializes UART with given baud rate                        |
| `uart_putchar()`     | `uint8_t data`                 | Sends a single byte over UART                                |
| `uart_puts()`        | `const uint8_t *str`           | Sends a null-terminated string from RAM                      |
| `uart_puts_P()`      | `const uint8_t *progmem_s`     | Sends a null-terminated string from program memory (FLASH)   |
| `uart_putdec()`      | `uint32_t val`                 | Sends a 32-bit unsigned integer as a decimal string          |
| `uart_puthex()`      | `uint32_t val`                 | Sends a 32-bit unsigned integer as a hexadecimal string      |
| `uart_getchar()`     | *(void)*                       | Receives a single byte from UART (blocking)                  |
| `uart_gets()`        | `uint8_t *buffer, uint8_t len` | Reads a string until CR/LF into buffer, null-terminated      |
| `uart_available()`   | *(void)*                       | Returns 1 if data is available in UART receive buffer        |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Add the files to your project

Copy these files into your AVR project:

- `GAGHL_AVR_UART.c`
- `GAGHL_AVR_UART.h`

### 2. Define `F_CPU`

In your project (before including headers), make sure to define CPU frequency:

```c
#define F_CPU 8000000UL  // or 16000000UL
```
### 3.Initialize UART
```c
#define F_CPU 8000000UL

#include "GAGHL_UART.h"

int main(void) {
    uart_init(UART_BAUD_9600);
    uart_puts("Hello, UART!\r\n");
    
    while (1) {
        if (uart_available()) {
            uart_putchar(uart_getchar());  // Echo back
        }
    }
}
```

## üîß Requirements

- AVR microcontroller (e.g. **ATmega32**, **ATmega16**, etc.)
- AVR-GCC or any compatible C toolchain
- `F_CPU` must be defined as either:
  - `8000000UL` (8 MHz)
  - `16000000UL` (16 MHz)

## üõ†Ô∏è TODO

- [ ] Add support for 20 MHz operation
- [ ] Add configuration options for parity and stop bits
- [ ] Implement optional interrupt-based RX/TX handling
- [ ] Add unit tests or simulation examples (e.g., with simavr or Proteus)
